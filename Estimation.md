Version:    1.0


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |              20               |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |              800             | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | |                16.000  
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |         1.600                          |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 48.000 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |  10     |               

# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |

| GUI prototype | 160 |
|design document |320|
|code |640|
| unit tests |160|
| api tests |160|
| management documents  |320|



# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|requirement engineering | 320 |
|GUI prototyping | 160 |
|design | 320 |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |1.600 ph| 10 weeks |
| estimate by product decomposition |2.080 ph| 13 weeks |
| estimate by activity decomposition |2250 ph| 14 weeks |

We have assumed for duration a team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week
