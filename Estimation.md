| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) | 10     |

# Summary
### 
| Title                              | Estimated effort | Estimated duration |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| estimate by size                   | 1.600 ph         | 10 weeks                                 |
| estimate by product decomposition  | 2.080 ph         | 13 weeks                                 |
| estimate by activity decomposition | 1784 ph          | 6.5 weeks (According to the Gantt chart) |

We have assumed for duration a team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week. After calculating the estimations, it seems that activity decomposition produces the smallest estimated duration which also seems to the most accurate one. The reason for this small estimated duration is the parallezitaion of vaious tasks which can be easily described using a Gantt chart. The main advantage of this approach is that we can make use of graphical interface to better describe the amount of time needed for each activity, milestones dates and the resources allocated to each activity.
